Project Approach (Brief)

The project follows a fully serverless architecture using AWS services.
The frontend is hosted on Amazon S3 as a static website. User authentication
is handled using AWS Cognito. API Gateway exposes RESTful APIs and routes
requests to AWS Lambda functions. These Lambda functions perform CRUD
operations on DynamoDB. This approach ensures scalability, security, and
cost efficiency without server management.
